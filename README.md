# Modified Monty Hall Problem
This is a modified monty hall problem where there is a 80 percent chance of an item being contained inside 4 containers and a 20 percent chance that it's outside. You open 3 containers, and nothing is there. The question is what's the probability that the item is in the last container. This python script attempts to simulate that problem.

## Running
installing dependencies:

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python3 modified_monty.py`
